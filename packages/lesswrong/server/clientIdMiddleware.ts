// TODO:
// - [X] Check if the cookies are forwarded when the refresh request is sent to CloudFront
// - [X] Make sure this doesn't add set-cookie to requests that might be cached
// - [ ] [Pending checking for duplicates] Rewrite ensure section as an INSERT ... ON CONFLICT query
// - [ ] Deal with timezone
//    - [X] Convert all instances of dates to use a <time> tag, so that the info is at least there for machines if needed
//    - [ ] Add the logic for timeOverride described in the PR (this will add a `maybeCached`)
// - [ ] Deal with the theme
//    - [ ] Bypass cache for those requests (fine because it doesn't persist for logged out anyway)
// - [ ] Deal with tabId
//    - [ ] Don't set it for cacheable requests, generate it on the client instead
// - [ ] Deal with A/B tests
//    - [ ] Set a flag that this is a cacheable request, throw an error if A/B tests are used (although given the existing cache
//          doesn't do this, maybe this isn't necessary)
// - [ ] Generate a clientId cookie in the CDN for users that don't have one (one will be created on the first analytics request, so not a huge deal if this is missed)
// - [ ] Add a setting to enable the caching thing, so other instances can still set cookies if they want (or ideally infer it from the request)
